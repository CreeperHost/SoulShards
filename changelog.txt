    - The display name is still Soul Shards Respawn.
- Temporarily removed commands
    - I'm too lazy to rewrite them for Brigadier
- Temporarily removed support for editing the structure (and catalyst) required

    - Shards are now able to distinguish between the different types of chicken
- [API] Added some new Binding related events
    - BindingEvent.NewBinding
        - Fired when a shard first gets bound to an entity. This event is cancellable.

        - Fired when a shard is meant to gain souls. The amount is modifiable.
    - BindingEvent.GetEntityName

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.8
------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed issue where all TCon smelting would produce corrupted essence
    - This was definitely *not* intentionally added to push users towards starting Soul Shards. Not at all.

    - I hate the capability contract.

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.5
------------------------------------------------------

- Re-implemented Blood Magic compatibility
    - Allows Soul Cages to require LP for every mob spawned.
    - Rate is `(sacrificialValue / 2) * entityHealth`

- Minor optimization in cage interaction handling
- Respect shard reset recipe config

- Soul Cage will now output a comparator level based on it's contained tier divided by the total tiers available.
    - For example, with the default config, a tier 3 shard will output a redstone signal of 9.
